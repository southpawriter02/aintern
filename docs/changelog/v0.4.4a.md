# v0.4.4a - Multi-File Core Models

**Released:** 2026-01-16

## Overview

Implements the core models for the Multi-File Creation system. These models form the foundation for multi-file proposals extracted from LLM responses, including batch operations, progress tracking, and validation.

## New Components

### Enums

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FileOperationType.cs` | Operation types: Create, Modify, Delete, Rename, Move, CreateDirectory |
| `FileOperationStatus.cs` | Status values: Pending, Applied, Skipped, Failed, Conflict, InProgress |
| `FileTreeProposalStatus.cs` | Proposal lifecycle: Pending, PartiallyApplied, FullyApplied, etc. |
| `BatchApplyPhase.cs` | Apply phases: Validating, CreatingBackups, WritingFiles, etc. |
| `ValidationSeverity.cs` | Issue severity: Info, Warning, Error |
| `ValidationIssueType.cs` | Issue types: FileExists, InvalidPath, DuplicatePath, etc. |

### Models

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FileOperation.cs` | Single file operation with path, content, status, factory methods |
| `FileTreeProposal.cs` | Multi-file proposal container with selection and query methods |
| `BatchApplyResult.cs` | Batch apply result with success/failure tracking and timing |
| `BatchApplyProgress.cs` | Progress reporting with phase and percentage |
| `ValidationIssue.cs` | Individual validation issue with path and severity |
| `ProposalValidationResult.cs` | Validation result container with query methods |

## Key Features

- **Factory Methods**: `FileOperation.FromCodeBlock()`, `FileOperation.CreateDirectory()`, etc.
- **Query Methods**: `FileTreeProposal.GetOperation()`, `GetOperationsByType()`, etc.
- **Selection Support**: `SelectAll()`, `DeselectAll()`, `ToggleSelection()` for batch operations
- **Computed Properties**: `TotalSizeBytes`, `LineCount`, `ProgressPercent`, etc.
- **Validation**: Error, Warning, Info severity levels with suggested fixes

## Testing

- **83 unit tests** across 4 test files
- All tests passing

## Dependencies

- Builds upon `CodeBlock` from v0.4.1
- Uses `ApplyResult` from v0.4.3
